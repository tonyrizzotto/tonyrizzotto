My name is Tony, I'm a Software Engineer located in the Greater Lousiville area. I’ve served as both architect and lead engineer in the complex e-commerce space: implemented domain-driven design, set observability and coding standards, and guided fast-moving teams to deliver reliably and on time. I’ve led major system refactors, migrations and re-platforming efforts to transition business capability and scale products independently. The systems I've designed handle complex accounting, revenue recognition and reporting, payments and invoicing, distributed fulfillment, entitlements and much more. I have a deep understanding of databases, ETL and optimizing for lean performance. 

This Github profile is where I iterate on ideas, not always seriously, but always for improvement. Anything you see here is something I really believe in or something that meant something to me during my journey in software.
