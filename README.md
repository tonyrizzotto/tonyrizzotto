I am a seasoned Staff Engineer focused on designing and delivering mission-critical software for high-growth businesses. I’ve served as both architect and lead engineer in the e-commerce space, specializing in scaling products and transitioning business capabilities through major system migrations and re-platforming efforts.

My experience includes:
- Domain-Driven Design: Implementing standards for observability and coding to help fast-moving teams deliver high-quality work.
- Infrastructure & Orchestration: Deep expertise in Kubernetes and Cloud Architecture, including zero-downtime migrations between environments.
- Complex Financial Systems: Designing systems that handle revenue recognition, accounting, distributed fulfillment, and global payments.

I have a deep interest in database optimization, ETL, and building for lean, high-performance scale.

Core Stack: Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python • Kubernetes, GCP • ArgoCD • GraphQL • PostgreSQL/NoSQL • BigTable • ETL • Pub/Sub • Async Messaging • Prometheus / OTEL • RudderStack/Avo/Mixpanel • Stripe • Recurly • Module Federation • Webpack/Vite

This Github profile is where I iterate on ideas, not always seriously, but always for improvement. Anything you see here is something I really believe in or something that meant something to me during my journey in software.
